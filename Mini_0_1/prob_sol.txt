Problems:

Registers were not initialized to zero. Hence the values were incorrect because the don't cares propagated. To fix this we created an additional edge case test for R0
in the Register bypass statement.

When reading the Switch, initially we were reading at every posedge clk, which didn't properly store in memory because the memory file operated at negedge clk. Solution was to 
read the switch at negedge clk.
